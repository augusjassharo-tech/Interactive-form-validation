Project Overview

Common Project Overview – IBM Naan Mudhalvan (5th Semester 2025–26)

Under the IBM Naan Mudhalvan Program, students are encouraged to design and develop full-stack applications integrating frontend technologies and Node.js REST APIs. The primary objective is to make learners proficient in understanding real-world problems, planning effective solutions, implementing technical designs, and deploying applications on cloud platforms such as Netlify or Vercel.

The project is divided into five structured phases:

1. Problem Understanding & Requirements – Identifying the problem, defining users, and specifying features.


2. Solution Design & Architecture – Selecting the tech stack and planning UI, API, and data handling.


3. MVP Implementation – Developing and testing the minimum viable product.


4. Enhancements & Deployment – Adding advanced features, performance checks, and deploying.


5. Demonstration & Documentation – Presenting the final output with complete documentation.



This approach ensures that students gain hands-on experience in modern software development workflows, including requirement analysis, API integration, version control (GitHub), and real-time deployment.

Project Overview – Interactive Form Validation

The Interactive Form Validation project focuses on developing a smart and user-friendly form validation system that enhances user experience and ensures data accuracy. Often, users face difficulties while filling online forms due to unclear error handling or delayed validation messages. This project aims to eliminate such issues by providing instant feedback as users type, using both client-side and server-side validation techniques.

The system will highlight invalid fields, display real-time hints, and prevent form submission until all inputs meet the defined criteria. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and Node.js REST API for backend verification. The solution includes regex-based input validation, password strength checking, email pattern matching, and security measures to prevent spam or malicious input.

After successful testing, the project will be deployed on Netlify/Vercel, accompanied by a detailed GitHub README, screenshots, and a final walkthrough. This project demonstrates the practical use of validation logic, UX design, and web security principles, aligning with the objectives of the IBM Naan Mudhalvan program to build industry-ready applications.
